\section{\texorpdfstring{Economic policy uncertainty in existing
literature
\label{sec_litreview}}{Economic policy uncertainty in existing literature }}\label{economic-policy-uncertainty-in-existing-literature}

Existing literature provide several definitions of uncertainty. In
general terms, Jurado, Ludvigson, and Ng
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Jurado2015}{2015}) define uncertainty as
volatility in shocks that cannot be forecasted by economic agents. Bloom
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bloom2014}{2014}) echo this by describing
uncertainty as a concept that occupies the minds of agents in relation
to possible future events. More specifically, Baker, Bloom, and Davis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}) define economic policy
uncertainty not only as uncertainty about policies as such, but also
about who is making policy decisions and the effects thereof. It is
important to note that uncertainty is defined in terms of all agents in
the economy - as stated by Bloom
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bloom2014}{2014}) - consumers, managers and
policymakers. The remainder of this paper will thus refer to EPU at this
aggregated level.

The sole purpose of this paper is to provide a narrative of the
evolution of economic policy uncertainty in South Africa that is heavily
supported by descriptive analysis. An obvious extension to this research
is to investigate the impact of uncertainty on key variables of
interest. Albeit not within the scope of this paper, it is still
pertinent to motivate the rationale for constructing a measure of EPU by
looking at the relationships existing literature have uncovered. A
delineation between a macro- and microeconomic focus is immediate in
this literature. This paper will suffice with motivating the usefulness
of a measure for EPU by referring to this literature below.

In terms of the microeconomy, Bachmann, Elstner, and Sims
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bachmann2013}{2013}) find that there is a
decline in production and employment in response to a shock in EPU.
Bloom (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bloom2014}{2014}) echoes that the level of
uncertainty at a microeconomic level (i.e.~individual industries, firms
and plants) is usually higher during times of economic recessions.
However, not sufficiently controlling for the economic conditions that
can also influence production and employment can confound the estimate
of the impact of EPU on these variables. To this end, Caggiano,
Castelnuovo, and Groshenny (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Caggiano2014}{2014})
show that not taking into account that uncertainty shocks occur mostly
in economic recessions, leads to an underestimation of the negative
relationship between uncertainty and unemployment. It is immediate that
aggregating the industry/firm level effects will feed into the
macroeconomy.

At the macroeconomic level, Baker, Bloom, and Davis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}) find that rising uncertainty
in the United States is a leading indicator for declining investment,
production and employment. However, since the global financial crisis
(GFC), most macroeconomic literature pertaining to uncertainty have been
concerned with linkages to financial markets. Caldara et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Caldara2016}{2016}) go as far in stating that
the interaction between uncertainty and financial shocks is ``toxic''
and that the GFC was likely due to an acute manifestation of this. Other
scholars establish relationships between EPU and the equity option
market (Kelly, Pástor, and Veronesi
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Kelly2016}{2016}), increased stock price
volatility (Baker, Bloom, and Davis
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}) and increased risk premia
(Pástor and Veronesi \protect\hyperlink{ref-Pastor2013}{2013}).

The above discussion illustrates the usefulness of a measure for EPU. It
now remains to be ascertained how exactly to measure it. Earlier
literature (see e.g. Bachmann, Elstner, and Sims
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Bachmann2013}{2013})) made use of survey data
and constructed an EPU index by measuring the discrepancies between
respondents' answers to forward-looking questions. Redl
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Redl2015}{2015}) takes an alternative approach,
employing inter alia data from professional forecasting competitions and
scrutinising official economic reviews released by the South African
Reserve Bank to construct an EPU index.

More recently, a novel approach by Baker, Bloom, and Davis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}) garnered academic praise and
an increasing number of scholars followed suit. The approach developed
by Baker, Bloom, and Davis (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016})
gauge EPU by extracting information from newspaper articles. The most
basic index is constructed using the frequency of articles containing
words related to uncertainty. Refinements on the basic index attempt to,
inter alia, control for linguistic modality (Tobback et al.
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tobback2018}{2018}), eliminate the need for human
classification of articles by using support vector machines
(Azqueta-Gavaldón \protect\hyperlink{ref-Azqueta-Gavaldon2017}{2017})
and provide a greater level of disaggregation in terms of policy
categories (Baker, Bloom, and Davis
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}). The methodologies of these
papers are not discussed here as it overlaps greatly with the
methodology discussed in section \ref{sec_method}.

Index for South Africa
\label{sec_EPU}}{Constructing an Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for South Africa }}\label{constructing-an-economic-policy-uncertainty-index-for-south-africa}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Data \label{sec_data}}{Data }}\label{data}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Methodology
\label{sec_method}}{Methodology }}\label{methodology}

In order to build an uncertainty index, the newspaper articles discussed
in section \ref{sec_data} is scrutinised. This paper presents two sets
of indices - the naive and the refined - both following the same
methodology. The delineating factor is the way in which the uncertainty
score for each article is calculated. As such, this calculation for the
respective uncertainty scores is discussed before explaining the general
methodology of constructing the indices.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Calculating uncertainty scores
\label{ss_uncertaintyscore}}{Calculating uncertainty scores }}\label{calculating-uncertainty-scores}

For the naive approach, the uncertainty score is simply a binary
variable that is equal to one if the article contains the word
``uncertain'' at least once and zero otherwise. Albeit being able to
quantify uncertainty to an extent, the naive index is rigid in its
application. Tobback et al. (\protect\hyperlink{ref-Tobback2018}{2018})
state that every article matching the aforementioned criteria forms part
of the naive index, regardless of the entity that the uncertainty is
related to. To control for this, the naive index is calculated for
uncertainty pertaining to specific topics. This is achieved by
identifying a subset of the articles pertaining to specific topics. This
is discussed in further detail in section \ref{ss_topics}.

A further shortcoming of the naive index is that articles are weighted
equally, i.e.~all articles containing the word ``uncertain'' contribute
one towards the uncertainty score. In reality, there is a range of words
that can convey uncertainty and not all articles convey the same level
of uncertainty. Therefore, the refined uncertainty index evaluates the
raw text data for words contained in the Loughran and Mcdonald
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Loughran2016}{2016}) uncertainty dictionary.
This dictionary consists of 297 words relating to uncertainty and thus
provides a more comparitive measure of sentiment (Loughran and Mcdonald
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Loughran2016}{2016}). Measuring the score in this
manner yields a continuous variable with each article's contribution to
the monthly uncertainty score equivalent to this score.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Identifying topic specific uncertainty
\label{ss_topics}}{Identifying topic specific uncertainty }}\label{identifying-topic-specific-uncertainty}

This paper presents four sets of uncertainty indices - monetary policy,
fiscal policy, financial markets and political uncertainty. To identify
each of these topics, the articles are searched for a set of keywords
pertaining to each topic. These keywords, displayed in table
\ref{tbl_keywords}, were decided based on a combination of existing
literature (inter alia Hardouvelis et al.
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Hardouvelis2018}{2018}) and Redl
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Redl2015}{2015})) and own initiatives. Only
articles that contain at least one of the keywords are included in the
subset for the calculation of a specific index.

\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Keywords per Index category \label{tbl_keywords}}

\begin{tabular}{rllll}

\end{table}

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Constructing the indices
\label{ss_indices}}{Constructing the indices }}\label{constructing-the-indices}

Having demonstrated the different ways in which the naive- and refined
approach measure the uncertainty score and how topic specific data
subsets are identified, it is now shown how these scores are translated
into an index. As mentioned, the methodology to calculate the naive- and
refined index are exactly the same. The only difference between the two
types of indices, is the way in which the uncertainty score is measured
as illustrated in section \ref{ss_uncertaintyscore}. As such the general
methodology as developed by Baker, Bloom, and Davis
(\protect\hyperlink{ref-Baker2016}{2016}) is explained.

To ease the discussion, the explanation will focus on the monetary
policy uncertainty index\footnote{This is of course arbitrary and all
  four indices are constructed in the same manner.}. As alluded to
earlier, the monetary policy data subset is defined so as to contain
only articles with at least one of the keywords of the monetary policy
category, i.e.~one of the 17 keywords in table \ref{tbl_keywords}. From
this data subset, 17 individual subindices are constructed - a subindex
for every keyword. This is achieved by applying an additional filter on
the data subset: working sequentially, the data subset is filtered to
articles containing one keyword at a time. This step thus provides 17
filtered data subsets that relate to each of the 17 keywords in the
monetary policy uncertainty category.

A daily uncertainty score is calculated as the mean score of the
articles in the filtered data subset\footnote{Calculating the mean
  controls for the volume of articles varying per day.}. The daily
uncertainty is aggregated to a monthly score by once again calculating
the mean of the daily uncertiaty scores. Finally, the monthly
uncertainty score is scaled which provides the index.

The above explanation can be framed mathematically as follows: Denote an
article as \(a_{jit}\) and define its uncertainty score as \(us_{jit}\)
where \(j\) denotes the article, \(i\) the day and \(t\) the month. The
mean uncertainty score per article constitutes the daily uncertainty
score, \(\frac{\sum_{j=1}^Jus_{jit}}{J}= US_{it}\). The monthly score is
calculated as the mean of the daily uncertainty scores per month,
\(\frac{\sum_{j=1}^JUS_{it}}{I}= US_{t}\).
